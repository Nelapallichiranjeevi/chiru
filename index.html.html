scale like tea, coffee and rubber. Here the term plantation or estate is used synonymously.

        <p>
            Tree planting is the process oftransplanting treeseedlings, generally for forestry,land reclamation, orlandscaping purpose. It differs from thetransplantation of largertrees inarboriculture, and from the lower costbut slower and less reliable distribution of treeseeds
        </p>
        <p>
            In silviculture the activity is known as reforestation, or a forestation , depending on whether the area being planted has or has not recently been forested. It involves planting seedlings over an area of land where the forest has been harvested or damaged by fire, disease or human activity. Tree planting is carried out in many different parts of the world, and strategies may differ widely across nations and regions and among individual reforestation companies. Tree planting is grounded info rest science, and if performed properly can result in the successful  regeneration of a deforested area. Reforestation is the commercial logging industry's answer to the large-scale destruction of old growth forests, but a planted forest rarely replicates the biodiversity and complexity of a natural forest
        </p>
        <p>
            Because trees remove carbon dioxide from the air as they grow, tree planting can be used as a geoengineering technique to remove
from the atmosphere. desert greening protects are also motivated by improved biodiversity and reclamation of natural water systems, but also improved economy and social welfare due to increased number of jobs in farming and forestry

        <h2>HOW TO PLANT A TREE:-</h2>
        <p>while planting each of these different types of trees differs in the details, all trees eventually end up in a hole. </p>
        <p><b>The most common mistake:-</b> when planting a tree is a digging hole , which is both too deep and too narrow.,  Too deep and the roots don't have access to sufficient oxygen to ensure proper growth. Too narrow and the root structure can't expand sufficiently to nourish and properly anchor the tree</p>
    </div>
    <div class="e">

    </div>
   </div>
   <div class="f">
    <p>As a general rule, trees should be transplanted no deeper than the soil in which they were originally grown. The width of the hole should be at least 3 times the diameter of the root ball or container or the spread of the roots in the case of bare root trees. This will provide the tree with enough worked earth for its root structure to establish itself. when digging in poorly drained clay soil, it is important to avoid glazing,</p>
    <p>Glazing occurs when the sides and bottom of a hole become smoothed forming a barrier, through which water has difficulty passing
        To break up the glaze, use a fork to work the bottom and drag the points along the sides of the completed hole. Also, raising the centre bottom of the hole slightly higher than the surrounding area. This allows water to disperse, reducing the possibility of water pooling in the planting zone.</p>

            <p>
            Balled and Bur lapped (B&B) trees, although best planted as soon as possible, can be stored for some time after purchase as long as the ball is kept moist and the tree stored in a shady area. <br>
B & B trees should always be lifted by the ball, never by the trunk <br>
The bur lap surrounding the ball of earth and roots should either be cut away completely mandatory, in the case of synthetic or plastic burlap0 or at least pulled back from the top third of the ball in the case of natural bur lap. Any string or twine should also be removed. Backfill soil combinations of peat moss, composted manure, topsoil, etc.) is then placed in the hole surrounding the tree just to the height of the ball or slightly lower to allow for some settling. be careful not to compress the back fill soil as this may prevent water from reaching the roots and the roots from expanding beyond the ball.

         <div>
           <p>Container trees though subject to greater heat and drying conditions than  B and B can also be stored for a brief period of time after purchase as long as the soil in the container is kept moist and the tree stored in a shady spot. The procedure for planting container trees is similar to that for B and B trees. To further assist this, lightly break up even the soil outside the planting one. This allows roots that Luckly move out of the planting one to be more resilient as they anchor into existing surrounding soil conditions. Once the tree is seated in the hole, the original soil is then back-filled into the hole to the soil level of the container. gain, remember not too overly compress the back-filled soil especially by tramping it with your feet. compress gently using your hands instead</p>

        <h1>Notch Planting</h1>
        <p>Notch is a V-shaped figure. Instead of digging a pit, a notch is made in the soil and seedling is planted. This is the quickest and most rough method than the first method. <br>
            This method is applied is sandy and areas with light soils. The spade is pushed into the soil obliquely and then pulled in the opposite direction. The seeding is put in the notch and the spade is pulled out. After pulling out the spade, the soil automatically returns and the notches filled back again. If the sol does not return then another notch is made at some distance and thus the first notch is filled automatically due to side pressure.
            Pre-germinated seeds are also planted by this method</p>
         <h1>Planting with Ball of Earth:</h1>
         <p>This method is applied to those species which are delicate, comparatively large in size and cannot bear exposure of roots. Handling of such plants must be by a ball of earth and not by the stem. The plant can live for longer periods and would not dir even if actual planting is delayed. The plant bonded with roots will supply food to the fronts for few days</p>
         <h1>Deep Planting:</h1>
         <p>Deep planting means that the seed collar of seedling should be below the soil surface and some portion of the stem should be buried in the soil. This method is adopted in very dry areas where moisture is very deep in the soil</p>
         <h1>Stump Planting:</h1>
         <p>It is root-shoot cutting. These are pruned root shoot sticks. Their sizes can vary but the common size is 9 inches root portion and 3 inches shoot portion dia ½ inches or 1 inch. <br>
            The advantage of stump planting in case of the carriage, less risk of damage during transplanting and the chances of success are more. It was suggested that the use of stump has resulted in rottening but not proven. See pic</p>
        <h1>Branch and Stem Cutting:</h1>
        <p>Branch and stem cuttings of poplar, willows, and Tamarix are commonly planted.</p>
        <h1>Brick planting:</h1>
        <p>In this method, the seedling is raised in the nursery in bricks made up of soil. In the center of the brick, there is a cavity (hole). This cavity is filled with fertile soil and the seedling is planted in it. When the seedlings are ready they are planted out along with the brick. This method is adopted in sandy desert areas where there is a problem of shifting sands.
            The disadvantage of this method is the cost of preparation of katcha Brick and their large weight.</p>

        Examples of tree plantation
    </h1>
    <p>India attempts to set record by planting 50 million trees in 24 hours <br>
        <br>
        More than 800,000 volunteers took part in a mass tree-planting exercise
in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh earlier this week, attempting
to plant 50 million trees in 24 hours
Q Search document
Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav told volunteers assembled
in the city of Kannauj: "The world has realized that serious efforts are needed to reduce carbon emissions to mitigate
the effects of global climate change. Uttar Pradesh has made a
beginning in this regard."
The state was hoping to set a world record for trees planted in one day,
which was previously set by Pakistan in 2013, with a comparatively
paltry 847,275 trees.
